# Salty Cube's
This is a unblocked game website I started a good while ago, and I plan to keep it going!
For now it is decently small and the games are choosen by people at my school, but I plan to get more than just my school playing it.

If you happen to come across this, please share it with other people! It helps the website grow and I get to sustain it.
(and who knows, maybe i'll be able to get a web domain for this one instead of just only the google sites one)

Oh did I forget to mention? This website is technically 2 websites! One google sites, the other github pages. So far only google sites has a domain but I plan to get this one a domain as well when I get enough money.
